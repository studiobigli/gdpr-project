# GDPR Obfuscator Project

A project to create a Python module that takes an input file address (.csv) and a list of column names, replacing the content of the cells in those columns with "***" obfuscating them to comply with GDPR rules. The module will then output a file with the obfuscated data with "-obfuscated" appended before the file extension.
